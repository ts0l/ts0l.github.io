thanks to Ryland Kurshenoff's wonderful [PSX jungle mix][jungle-mix], I recently lost at least 2 hours of work time to my ears.

mix is just far too complete a banger to ignore. plenty of vibey, head-bobbing tracks to be found in it, but I caught myself hearing a song I liked in the mix, going to the track listing to see where it was from, and encountering a game I'd never heard of before.

I did this so much that I started up a list of games I thought I'd buy just for the soundtrack, as an excuse to dig in to a new world, learn some new stuff, and maybe find some semi-lost media! I came up with this list:

- add your notes here!
- why haven't I already? imagine syncing Apple Notes to Windows! hell no

*editor's note*: as I typed the backticks above, I realized the Windows had switched me back to `ENG-INTL` AGAIN! keeps screwing up my typing. don't even know why it's there, I should only have `GA` and `US`.

not only did I build a list (*gasp*), I actually found a few games! [Rushdown (NTSC-U/C)][rushdown] and [Sengoku Cyber - Fujimaru Jigokuhen (NTSC-J)][sc-fj] were both available this last week when I went by Pink Gorilla Games in the U District for $4-5, so I picked them up, ripped the .bin+.cue off of them, and started to download some software for exploring the disc images.

i'll write future notes later about the software I've discovered so far, as well as the general process of exploring PSX ROMs for the purposes of asset retrieval, but I've just got to say that it's so goddamn rewarding!! I've frankly got no real clue as to the gameplay of SC-FJ, nor the plot, nor themes or nothing. but the music they have for the credits goes so unrespectfully hard.

[**here's the track I'm yappin about**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5_wU9X1pc&t=2194s)

what a beautiful, smooth synth lead, and a sick good bass tone... but that `B2BA B2BA .ABA B2BA` motif is the cake-taker for me. can't not toe-tap, can't not nod head.

the reason this is cool is because I can't find another source on youtube of this amazing track, and when exploring the .bin, I found that it actually has a second version, played maybe in the opening credits?? that has a ridiculous beat switch at the point when the end credits version of the tune stops. I wish I could post it here.

maybe someday :)
